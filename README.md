Act as a senior front-end game developer.

I already built a browser-based survival game using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
Now I want to convert and upgrade this game so that it works smoothly on MOBILE PHONES.

GOAL:
When I send the game link to my friend, he should be able to open it on his mobile
and play comfortably like a real mobile game.

CURRENT GAME IDEA:
- Top-down survival game
- Player movement
- Reverse controls (Up ↔ Down, Left ↔ Right)
- Enemies that move automatically
- Start, Game Over, Restart
- No external libraries

NEXT STEP REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT):

1. MOBILE CONTROLS
   - Replace keyboard arrow controls
   - Use on-screen touch controls (virtual buttons or joystick)
   - Controls must work smoothly with finger touch
   - No need for keyboard on mobile

2. RESPONSIVE DESIGN
   - Game must adapt to different screen sizes
   - Work well on Android phones
   - No overflow or zoom issues
   - UI elements must be finger-friendly

3. ANTI-GRAVITY / SMOOTH MOVEMENT
   - Movement should feel smooth (not step-by-step)
   - Player should glide / float slightly (anti-gravity feel)
   - Reverse control logic must still work correctly on mobile

4. GAME STABILITY
   - No control bugs
   - Restart must work with single tap
   - Enemies must not overlap UI buttons
   - Input must be disabled during Game Over screen

5. USER EXPERIENCE
   - Clear Start and Restart buttons
   - Clean modern dark theme
   - Simple HUD (time / score)
   - Game should feel like a real mobile mini-game

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- Design the game architecture with mobile-first thinking
- Suggest the best type of mobile control (buttons or joystick) and why
- Ensure reverse controls remain deterministic and bug-free
- Do NOT use external libraries
- Keep the solution simple, clean, and reliable

IMPORTANT:
- This game will be shared with friends via link
- It must work by just opening the link in mobile browser
- No app installation, no keyboard dependency

The final result should feel like a proper mobile browser game
that I can confidently share and showcase.
